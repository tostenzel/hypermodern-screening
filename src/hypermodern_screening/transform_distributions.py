    Converts sample from uniform distribution to standard normal space

    Parameters
    ----------
    uniform_deviates
        Draws from Uniform[0,1].
    numeric_zero
        Used to substitute zeros and ones before applying `scipy.stats.norm`

    morris_trajectory

    Notes
    -----
    This transformation is already applied as option in `morris_trajectory`.
    The reason is that `scipy.stats.norm` transforms the random draws from the
    unit cube non-linearily including the addition of the step. To obtain
    non-distorted screening measures, it is important to also account for this
    transformation of the step in the denominator to not violate the definition of
    the function derivation.
    The parameter `numeric_zero` can be highly influential. I prefer it to be
    relatively large to put more proportional, i.e. less weight on the extremes.

    """Transform u to z_c.

    Transformation from standard normal to multivariate normal space with given
    correlations following [1], page 77-102.

    Step 1) Compute correlation matrix.
    Step 2) Introduce dependencies to standard normal sample.
    Step 3) De-standardize sample to normal space.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z_row
        Row of uncorrelated standard normal deviates.
    cov
        Covariance matrix of correlated normal deviates.
    mu
        Expectation values of correlated normal deviates

    Returns
    -------
    x_norm_row
        Row of correlated normal deviates.
    correlate_step
        Lower right corner element of the lower Cholesky matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    Importantly, the step in the numerator of the uncorrelated Elementary Effect
    is multiplied by `correlate_step`. Therefore, this factor has to multiply
    the step in the denominator as well to not violate the definition of the
    function derivation.
    This method is equivalent to the one in [2], page 199 which uses the Cholesky
    decomposition of the covariance matrix directly. This saves the scaling by SD and
    expectation.
    This method is simpler and slightly more precise than the one in [3], page 33, for
    normally distributed paramters.
    [1] explains how Rosenblatt and Nataf transformation are equal for normally
    distributed deviates.
